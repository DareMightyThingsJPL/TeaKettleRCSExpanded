If CryoEngines, Kerbal Atomics, or Rational Resources is present, expect 5 fuel options with detailed tooltip in accordance with the offerings of Rational Resources Nuclear Family. Provides basic LiquidFuel option (and only this option) if these mods are not present or if "Kerbal Atomics use LiquidFuel" patch/modlet is present.

Stock inventory volumes thanks to LinuxGuruGamer's [Part Volume](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KSP_PartVolume) calculator mini mod. [Forum thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/201354-112x-ksp-part-volumes/).
