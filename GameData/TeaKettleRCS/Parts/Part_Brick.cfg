	description = While an engineer at home was very forgetful with their water kettle, their creative youngster had the brilliant idea to fly paper planes into the steam plume and see what happened. The planes went up, up and away! The engineer cleaned up, of course, but saw the idea and brought it to work and found amazing success with the application of a nuclear reactor as the heat source, and a heat exchanger built into the part.
